PRINTF

The printf format string is a control parameter used by a class of functions in the input/output libraries of C
and many other programming languages.
The string is written in a simple template language: characters are usually copied literally into the function's output, 
but format specifiers, which start with a % character, indicate the location and
method to translate a piece of data (such as a number) to characters.

The syntax for a format placeholder is
%[parameter][flags][width][.precision][length]type
